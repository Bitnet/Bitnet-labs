---

## ðŸ”¹ Level 0 â†’ 1
**Goal:** Connect to the Bandit server via SSH.  
**Approach:** Use the given user and port.

Command:
cat ./-

cat .hidden

ðŸ”¹ Level 4 â†’ 5
Goal: Identify the human-readable file among many.

Command:
cd inhere
file ./*
cat ./-file07

ðŸ”¹ Level 5 â†’ 6
Goal: Find a file of a specific size (1033 bytes).
Approach: Use find with size filter.
Command:
find inhere/ -type f -size 1033c
cat inhere/maybehere07/.file2

ðŸ”¹ Level 6 â†’ 7
Goal: Find a file by owner, group, and size.
Approach: Use find filtering user, group, and file size.
