# Mini Port Scanner (Python)

Simple TCP port scanner built with Python sockets.  
This project is part of my personal Red Team learning labs (**Bitnet-labs**).

## Features
- Scans a range of TCP ports on a given host
- Uses Python's native `socket` module
- Prints all open ports found
- Lightweight and dependency-free

## Usage

```bash
python3 mini_scanner.py <host> <start_port> <end_port>
