# Projects

This folder contains small projects and practical exercises developed during my Red Team and Offensive Security learning journey.  
Each project is self-contained, with its own README and example usage.

## Available Projects

- **port-scanner-bash/**  
  A simple port scanner written in Bash using loops and `nc`/`bash` features.

- **port-scanner-python/** *(in progress)*  
  A minimal port scanner in Python using sockets.

More projects will be added here as I progress through different phases of my learning path.
